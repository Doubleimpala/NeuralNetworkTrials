This is due to the fact that any attempt to measure the position or momentum of a particle necessarily involves interacting with it, which introduces uncertainty into the measurement. The uncertainty principle has important implications for our understanding of the subatomic world and has had a significant impact on the development of quantum mechanics."],

It states that the change in internal energy of a closed system is equal to the heat added to the system, minus the work done by the system.The second law of thermodynamics, also known as the law of increasing entropy, states that the total entropy of a closed system will always increase over time. This means that the level of disorder or randomness within the system will always increase, and the system will tend to reach a state of equilibrium. Entropy is a measure of the level of disorder or randomness within a system. It is a measure of the energy dispersal within a system, and it is related to the number of possible microstates that a system can have."],
